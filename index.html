            <h3>1. Start the Game :</h3>
            <p>= > Press any key on your keyboard to begin the game.</p>
            <p>= > The game will display a sequence by animating up one of the colored buttons.<br></p>
            <p>= > <b>Note:</b> Do not press a button to start the game.</p>

            <h3>2. Watch the Sequence:</h3>
            <p>= > Pay close attention as the game animating up one or more buttons in a specific order.<br></p>
            <p>= > Each round, the sequence will get longer by one additional button.<br></p>

            <h3>3. Repeat the Sequence:</h3>
            <p>= > After the game shows the sequence, itâ€™s your turn.<br></p>
            <p>= > Click the buttons in the exact same order as they were displayed.<br></p>
            <p>= > If you successfully match the sequence, the game will move on to the next round with a longer sequence.<br></p>

            <h3>4. Keep Playing:</h3>
            <p>= > The game will continue to add buttons to the sequence as long as you correctly repeat them.<br></p>
            <p>= > Try to remember the sequences as they grow longer and more complex!<br></p>

            <h3>5. Game Over:</h3>
            <p>= > If you click a button out of order, the game will end.<br></p>
            <p>= > You can start a new game by clicking a key word.<br></p>
